# 🍊 Duke Halal Menu Scraper — How to Use

## 1. Install Python

Make sure you have **Python 3.x** installed. You can check by running:

```bash
python --version
```

If it’s not installed, [download Python here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

---

## 2. Install Required Packages

Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install:

- **selenium**: browser automation library  
- **webdriver-manager**: automatically downloads the right version of ChromeDriver

---

## 3. Run the Script

Save your script as a file, for example:

```bash
halal_scraper.py
```

Then run it with:

```bash
python halal_scraper.py
```

---

## 4. What Happens

- The script opens Duke’s NetNutrition website  
- Dismisses the initial popup  
- Applies the “Halal” filter  
- Visits each **open** dining unit  
- Collects **menu categories and Halal meals**  
- Writes the result into a file named:

```
halal_menus.txt
```

## 5. Output Example

```

    - Grilled Chicken Breast
  Build Your Own Burger (Choose Your Ingredients):
    - Beef Patty
```

---

## 6. Notes

- Make sure **Google Chrome** is installed (it’s used by Selenium)  
- Don’t worry about ChromeDriver — `webdriver-manager` handles it  
- The script skips **closed restaurants** and filters out **duplicate meal names**
